			<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
			
			<p>Having completed a mathematics degree, with a specialisation in applied mathematics, I have a wealth of experience solving intricate problems and working with complex dynamic systems. Some of the fields I studied include the abstract world of quantum mechanics, the vital area of mathematical medicine and biology and the versatile realm of statistics - all of which required me to work meticulously and innovatively to construct precise solutions.</p>
			
			<p>With regards to coding, the statistics modules I studied equipped me with practical experience utilising R, a software environment for statistical computing. One assignment that I completed involved developing and refining a mathematical model to predict the body fat content of 50 individuals. There were also many instances during my degree where problems were required to be solved numerically, instead of by hand. MATLAB is a programming language that I customarily used to obtain numerical solutions to complex problems.</p>
				
			<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
			
			<p>One highlight of my educational journey was when I received my AS-Level results in Year 12. I studied maths, further maths, physics and chemistry, and achieved the best grades in my age group with four As. Continuing into Year 13, I was the only student studying more than three subjects, along with being the only person studying further maths. I achieved awards in maths, physics and chemistry for being the highest achiever in each discipline. My hard work paid off, and I secured my place to study mathematics at the University of Nottingham; something I aspired to achieve from a young age.</p>
			
			<p>I worked as a tutor of maths, physics and chemistry, while studying my A-levels. The job was challenging since it required me to adapt my explanations of complex topics to suit the personal needs of the student, thus enhancing my communication skills. However, the job was also satisfying when a student grasped a concept - I was able to see the moment the penny dropped in their mind. One collaborative effort which I oversaw was the formulation of our GCSE maths papers. I was in charge of formatting the papers, testing papers written by others and attending meetings to discuss possible improvements. In addition to this, I wrote some of the papers myself and also trained another colleague to format papers, prior to my departure. </p>
				
			<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
			
			<p>While I have had many hobbies during my life, my favourite and most recent is chess. I learned the rules of chess as a child, but only started to study the game seriously at the beginning of November 2020. Chess is such a beautiful and well-balanced game; its rules are simple, yet its possibilities are endless. One feature of study that I thoroughly enjoy is implementing technology, in the form of a chess engine, to analyse my games against my opponents. Utilising engines enables me to identify weaknesses in my game and constantly improve. My study has also included analysing the Queen's Gambit opening, which is my opening of choice as white, reading books and solving tactical puzzles.</p>
			
			<p>Some aspects of programming that I love are its versatility and limitless implications, which allow continuous development of transferable skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking. I have employed my enhanced skills to learn other languages/software, such as Excel, LaTeX, Python 3, Git/GitHub and HTML, in my spare time. In the future, I plan to learn other languages such as CSS, JavaScript and Java. Furthermore, I would love to work on a large product to implement the knowledge I have learned, improve my skills, and showcase my abilities.</p>
